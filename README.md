## General info
M2K (M2000) is a simulation of the Infinite Monkey Theorem.  
  
It states that if a lot of monkeys type on typewriters infinitely, they will write all of Shakespeare's works.   
  
This simulator simulates that. And calculates the chance of a sentence or word actually being written.  

M2000 is an updated version of M1000
